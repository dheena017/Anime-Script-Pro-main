Your response MUST be **10,000-15,000+ words** MINIMUM. This is a professional world bible, not a summary. Each of the 34 sections above must receive substantial elaboration:

### For EACH Main Section (1-34):
- Provide 300-450 words of content per section
- Include 5-10 specific named examples per section (cities, cultures, items, events, NPCs)
- Provide 3+ detailed sub-sections with hierarchical depth
- Include numerical specifics: populations, percentages, distances, timeframes, costs
- Include visual/sensory descriptions: colors, sounds, textures, smells, tastes where relevant
- Explain 3-5 cause-and-effect chains showing why the world works this specific way
- Provide 2-3 specific scenarios showing how this section impacts characters/story
- Include both micro (individual/family) and macro (civilization/world) perspectives

### Mandatory Detail Requirements:
- **Naming Convention**: Provide 50+ specific proper names (locations, people, organizations, artifacts, events, factions)
- **Numerical Specificity**: Include at least 50 concrete numbers (distances, populations, percentages, years, temperatures, monetary values, costs, timeframes)
- **Interconnectedness Examples**: Identify and explain 15+ specific points where different world sections influence each other

- **Social Dynamics**: Describe specific class tensions with real examples of privilege gaps and social mobility barriers
- **Conflict Seeds**: Identify 8+ potential conflicts waiting to erupt with specific trigger events and escalation paths

### Sensory Immersion (Must Include Extensively):
- **Visual**: Describe dominant color palettes for each major region, lighting conditions at different times, architectural signatures, distinctive visual landmarks, seasonal visual changes
- **Auditory**: What sounds define each area? Market sounds, combat sounds, magical sounds, natural ambience, music styles, warning signals, celebratory noise?

### Cause-and-Effect Mandate (EXTENSIVE):
Every statement must connect to broader world logic. Provide detailed explanations:
- ❌ AVOID: "There's a desert to the east."
- ✅ BETTER: "The Shalazar Desert exists because the Meridian Mountains block rainfall, creating a rain shadow that extends 400 miles east. This barren expanse forces trade routes northward through the treacherous Spine Pass, making northern settlements wealthier and more defensible. The harsh desert has bred the nomadic Khar'dun people, whose expertise with minimal resources makes them invaluable mercenaries. However, this also means northern nobles hoard wealth, creating resentment among southern populations..."

### Interconnectedness Requirements (Show Complex Cause-and-Effect Webs):

- How do tech limitations create social structures?
- How does magic/tech infrastructure determine political power?
- How do rare phenomena create religion and superstition?

- How does world design naturally support the story you want to tell?

### Character-Story Impact Examples (Include 5-8 for each section):
For each major world element, explain how it creates dramatic situations:
- Example 1: "The rigid caste system means a talented fighter born to merchants can never officially join the warrior class, forcing them to prove themselves through illegal duels. This creates a constant underground fighting scene that serves as cover for political assassinations."
- Example 2: "The seasonal flooding means entire neighborhoods must be abandoned during monsoon season. Wealthier families own property in multiple zones; poorer families must choose: lose their home or lose their livelihood by relocating temporarily."
- Example 3: "The prophecy that 'one born of two bloods shall break the chain' has persecuted every mixed-race child for 300 years, creating a culture of hiding identity and a hidden network of illegitimate half-siblings who don't know each other exist."

### Output Format (MANDATORY):
- Use numbered sections (## 1. through ## 34.)
- Use hierarchical bullet points (-, --, ---)
- Use bold for key terms and proper nouns (**Example**)
- Use italic for sensory descriptions (*crimson silk*, *acrid smoke*)

- Include section summaries (3-4 sentences) at the end of each major section (except short sections)
- Include a final "World Coherence Check" section verifying internal consistency across all 34 sections
- Include a "Narrative Potential Summary" showing how the world naturally supports story

### Word Count Tracking:
- Each section should average 300-400 words minimum (34 sections = 10,200+ words baseline)
- Target 12,000-15,000 words for premium professional-grade world bible
- NO section can be under 250 words
- NO examples can be generic or vague—every example must be specific, memorable, and tied to world logic
- Longer sections (Power System, Factions, Geography) should be 500-700 words

### QUANTITY REQUIREMENTS (Explicit Minimums):
- Minimum 60 specific named locations/cities/landmarks
- Minimum 50 named NPCs, leaders, or historical figures
- Minimum 10 named factions, organizations, or cultural groups (from sections 6, 7, 30, etc.)
- Minimum 30 specific power/ability examples with mechanics
- Minimum 50 numerical data points (populations, distances, costs, percentages, timeframes)

- Minimum 15 specific cause-and-effect chains showing world logic
- Minimum 8 specific potential story arcs that naturally emerge from world design
- Minimum 20 environmental/architectural descriptions with sensory details

## PRIME DIRECTIVE (ABSOLUTE):
You MUST strictly adhere to consistency. Every aspect of the world setting—from physical geography to power systems, social structures to sensory details—must be logically interconnected and evocatively coherent. This is a world where EVERYTHING connects to everything else.

EXPLICITLY AVOID:
- Contradictory lore (establish clear rules and follow them)
- Powerscaling inconsistencies (define power ceilings clearly)
- Cultural inconsistencies (cultures should reflect their environment and values)
- Generic fantasy tropes without justification
- Flat world design with no internal cause and effect
- Underspecified factions, cultures, or environmental logic
- Brevity: this must be an EXHAUSTIVE, ENCYCLOPEDIC world bible
- Vague references: ALWAYS be specific with names, numbers, and examples
- Isolated concepts: ALWAYS show how each element connects to the broader world
- Placeholder language: ALWAYS use concrete, evocative, memorable descriptions
