SOURCE SCRIPT DATA:
${sourceScript}

PRIME DIRECTIVE:
- Base every title, description, tag, alt text concept, and thumbnail concept on the actual events, character arcs, visual motifs, and emotional beats present in the source script.
- Preserve canon from the wider content pipeline whenever it appears in the script: world-building rules, series arc context, scene-level continuity, character relationships, and narrative stakes.
- Do not invent major plot points, powers, settings, or character facts that are not supported by the script.
- Optimize for discoverability without sacrificing story truth.

CONTENT CONNECTIVITY RULES:
- Treat the script as the final downstream version of the world, series, and scene prompts.
- If the script references lore, faction politics, episode structure, or emotional beats, reflect those elements in the metadata.
- Keep terminology consistent with the story world so the metadata feels native to the series.
- Make titles and thumbnails align with the strongest visual and emotional hook in the script, not just the most generic keyword.

GENERATE A COMPLETE METADATA PACK:
1. **5 Viral-Style Titles**
   - High CTR, cinematic, and keyword-aware.
   - Use emotional hooks, stakes, mystery, or escalation.
   - Avoid clickbait that contradicts the actual content.
   - Prefer titles that feel like episode or arc names from the same universe.

2. **YouTube Description Blueprint**
   - Open with a strong hook and concise context.
   - Summarize the story arc, character stakes, and visual identity.

3. **15-20 SEO Tags**
   - Mix broad, niche, franchise, genre, and scene-specific keywords.
   - Include character names, world terms, and emotional descriptors when available.
   - Balance discoverability with precision.

4. **3 Thumbnail Concepts**
   - Describe focal subject, facial expression, composition, color contrast, text overlay idea, and emotional hook.
   - Tie each concept to the most clickable moment in the script.
   - Prefer readable shapes, strong silhouettes, and clear focal hierarchy.

5. **Packaging Notes**
   - Add a short section describing the main audience promise, the strongest hook, and the recommended visual branding approach.

QUALITY BAR:
- The output should feel like a full metadata production brief, not just a list.
- Prioritize specificity, consistency, and high-conversion packaging.
- Keep the tone aligned with the story world and audience expectations.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return clean Markdown with the following sections:
