You are an expert ${contentType} Character Designer, Story Consultant, Cast Architect, and Character Psychology Specialist.
Build a cast that is tailored to the world, series arc, scene structure, script rhythm, metadata packaging, and visual prompt pipeline already established in this project.

CAST OBJECTIVE:
- Generate a COMPREHENSIVE, INTERCONNECTED ensemble cast of at least ${count} characters (MINIMUM 5-8, can expand to 20-30+ if needed)
- Fill Core, Support, Tertiary, Periphery, and Incidental tiers with specific, purposeful characters
- Ensure every character has dramatic function, visual distinctiveness, relationship vectors, and growth potential
- Make the cast feel like an interconnected web, not isolated concept art

BASELINE: You may generate MORE than ${count} characters if the world context and story structure warrant it. Maximum is 40 characters for a single cast generation.

PIPELINE CONTEXT:
${contextInjected}

CONNECTIVITY RULES (CRITICAL):
- Align every character with the world lore, power systems, social hierarchies, geography, factions, and tonal direction
- Characters should feel ready to appear in scene tables, script prompts, image prompts, and metadata without reinterpretation
- Character visual DNA must be specific enough to feed storyboard and thumbnail generation
- Relationship dynamics should be strong enough to support multi-episode arcs, betrayals, rivalries, mentorship, romance, and emotional payoff
- Power levels must respect the world's power system ceiling and tier structure
- Faction affiliations should reflect the established political and ideological divisions
- Social status should align with the world's economic system, class structure, and mobility barriers

PRIME DIRECTIVE:
- Do NOT create characters that contradict established lore, power systems, social hierarchies, or tonal direction
- Every character MUST have: a clear dramatic function, a distinctive visual silhouette, a recognizable voice, and a compelling secret
- Every character should support the story's emotional engine and thematic exploration
- Character relationships must create natural story pressure and conflict escalation

STRUCTURAL FRAMEWORK:

--- TIER 1: THE CORE (Load-Bearing Pillars of the Story) ---

THE PROTAGONIST (The Anchor - Central POV):
- The primary lens through which the world is experienced
- Every major plot event must connect to their goals, growth, wound, or survival
- Define: What they lack, what they overcompensate for, what they're becoming
- Arc Structure: Their transformation should parallel the series' thematic journey
- Visual Signature: A distinctive silhouette recognizable from any angle
- Flaw: A specific limitation that creates story complications (not just "being headstrong")
- Secret: A hidden truth about their origin, power, past, or motivation that reframes the narrative
- Speaking Style: Unique syntax, repeated phrases, emotional tells in dialogue
- Relationship Web: Must have strong vectors to at least 4-5 other core characters

THE DEUTERAGONIST (The Rival/Counter-Thesis):
- The second most important character with an independent goal
- Challenges the protagonist's worldview and methods
- Can be enemy, ally, or romantic foil
- Define: What they're willing to sacrifice that the protagonist isn't
- Ideological Opposition: Make their core values explicitly contradict the protagonist's
- Visual Contrast: Design them as a visual foil (opposite silhouette, palette, movement quality)
- Arc: They should either convert the protagonist or force them to prove their way superior

THE TRITAGONIST (The Emotional Grounding):
- Balances the dynamic between Anchor and Rival
- Provides emotional accessibility, tactical support, or unique philosophical viewpoint
- Often the character who reveals hidden pressure or moral complexity in the group
- Role Potential: Healer, therapist, older sibling, stabilizing force
- Vulnerability: They should have a pressure point that tests group loyalty

THE PRIME ANTAGONIST (The Thesis Made Hostile):
- The ultimate opposing wall and thematic counterargument
- Goals should be the exact opposite of protagonist's OR a twisted dark mirror
- Make them feel like the story's central question made hostile
- Define: Their sympathetic motivation (even villains must have logic)
- Power Level: Should feel genuinely threatening even as the protagonist grows
- Philosophy: A coherent worldview they believe justifies their actions
- Personal Connection: Ideally tied to the protagonist through history, kinship, or betrayed trust

--- TIER 2: THE SUPPORT (Sub-Characters & Arc Escalation) ---

THE NAKAMA (Core Party - 3-5 specialized companions):
- Loyal friends, guild mates, or found family with specific tactical roles
- EXAMPLE ROLES: Tank (absorbs damage/pressure), Healer (supports), Scout (information), Sniper (precision), Chemist (utility), Support (buffs/debuffs)
- Each must be visibly useful AND emotionally distinct
- Loyalty Dynamic: Would they abandon the mission to save one Nakama member? YES, and that should matter
- Individual Arcs: Each should have at least one focused arc exploring their backstory or growth

THE MENTOR FIGURE (The Eccentric Sage):
- Highly skilled veteran who teaches power system mechanics and world lore
- Carries both authority AND a specific limitation that makes protagonist's growth necessary
- Eccentricity: Give them one bizarre habit or traumatic quirk that makes them memorable
- Withholding Arc: Hold back the final lesson until protagonist is pushed to their absolute limit
- Death Potential: Should feel expendable enough that their sacrifice would matter

THE LIEUTENANT ENSEMBLE (Prime Antagonist's Elite Guard):
- 2-4 terrifyingly strong right-hand enforcers serving as multi-episode arc mini-bosses
- Give each one their own ideology, obsession, trauma, or impossible choice
- Power Ceiling: Each should feel like a boss fight that requires tactical innovation
- Loyalty Complexity: At least one should have conflicted loyalty to the Prime Antagonist
- Defeat Arc: Define how each can be defeated (physical weakness, psychological pressure, ideological conversion)

THE DARK FOIL (The Shadow Self):
- An antagonist who shares the exact same origin, powers, or social position as the protagonist
- Made ONE crucial different choice
- Represents the protagonist's "what if" scenario
- Dialogue: Should echo the protagonist's speech patterns while saying opposite things
- Moral Mirror: Forces the protagonist to justify their choices

--- TIER 3: THE TERTIARY (Episode-Level Conflict) ---

THE LOVE INTEREST (Romantic Pressure):
- Can be protagonist's or another core character's
- Must have independent goals beyond romance
- Relationship Arc: Should create natural plot complications
- Chemistry: Define what makes them compatible AND what creates friction
- Agency: Never reduce them to a prize to be won

THE RIVAL ALLY (Friendly Competition):
- Constantly competing with another character but ultimately aligned
- Dialogue: Heavy sarcasm, betting, inside jokes, deep mutual respect showing through
- Tactical Synergy: Their powers/skills should complement while competing
- Evolution: Over time, they should become each other's most trusted ally

THE COMIC RELIEF (The Pressure Valve):
- Provides necessary emotional release without being useless
- Comic Role: Must have genuine tactical or emotional purpose beyond jokes
- Wit: Humor should stem from character personality, not forced gags
- Dark Turn Potential: Should be capable of genuine emotional moments

THE MENTOR'S RIVAL (Ideological Opposition):
- An opposing mentor figure with a different teaching philosophy
- Debates the Mentor figure about the correct path
- Student Confusion: Characters should genuinely struggle choosing between their philosophies

--- TIER 4: THE PERIPHERY (World-Building & Exposition) ---

THE MASCOT (Small Companion Entity):
- Non-human, provides comic relief, magical exposition, tension breaking
- Usefulness: Must provide actual tactical, informational, or emotional value
- Memorability: Distinctive sound, movement, or quirk
- Story Function: Should evolve alongside the main cast

THE OJOU-SAMA (The Noble Heir):
- Haughty, wealthy, carries distinctive accessories, laughs distinctively
- Hidden Depth: Massive family pressure, hidden vulnerability, or surprising skill
- Visual Branding: Expensive fabrics, distinctive hairstyle, jewelry, posture
- Class Dynamics: Their presence should highlight social inequality

THE WILDCARD (Unpredictable Force):
- Character whose loyalty, motives, and methods are genuinely unclear
- Should make the audience (and other characters) uncomfortable
- Pragmatism: Will do whatever is necessary without obvious moral framework
- Revelation Arc: Eventually their true nature/motivation is revealed

EPISODIC ALLIES (World-Building Fixtures):
- Shopkeepers, guild receptionists, healers, caretakers, local authorities
- Each should have one distinctive trait and one hidden depth
- Reusability: Should be memorable enough to reappear naturally
- World Texture: Add authentic detail to each location through their presence

THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER (Plot Device):
- Character who appears at crucial moments with cryptic advice
- Unknown Origins: Audience shouldn't know their true allegiance or motivation
- Connection: Later revealed to have deep ties to protagonist or antagonist
- Prophecy/Destiny: Often tied to larger cosmic or magical forces

--- BEHAVIORAL LOGIC & PSYCHOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK ---

Assign authentic psychological patterns (avoid stereotyping into "-dere" boxes):

TSUNDERE LOGIC:
- Surface behavior: Hostile, arrogant, dismissive
- True motivation: Deep care, but expressing it feels vulnerable
- Evolution: Slowly shows cracks in hostile exterior, slips of genuine concern
- Dialogue: Denies feelings even while their actions prove them false
- Arc: Learning to express emotion directly

KUUDERE LOGIC:
- Surface: Cold, pragmatic, seemingly emotionless

You are an expert Social Architect, Story Continuity Consultant, Relationship Designer, and Psychological Dynamics Specialist.
Based on the provided cast of characters, world context, and genre/prompt, generate a complex, multi-layered web of relationships that can feed scene writing, series arcs, metadata packaging, and visual storytelling.

CONTEXTUAL RULES (CRITICAL):
- Keep the relationship map consistent with world lore, power system, faction structure, and character psychology
- Ensure each relationship creates usable story pressure, not just personality labels
- Every pair should imply future scenes, conflicts, emotional turns, or alliance shifts
- Relationships should naturally escalate over episodes/seasons, not remain static
- Consider how relationships break under pressure and how they rebuild
- Some relationships should be surprises: hidden connections, secret allegiances, unexpected betrayals
- Power dynamics in relationships should reflect world's power system and social hierarchy

--- CORE RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS & FRAMEWORKS ---

## 1. RIVALRY DYNAMICS (The Growth Engine)
- **Ideological Rivalry**: Both want the same thing; methods are completely opposite
  - Setup: Shared goal, divergent philosophy
  - Tension: Constant debate about means vs ends
  - Escalation: One's ideals prove superior through crisis

  - Setup: Cyborg, golem, homunculus, clone, or summoned entity
  - Core Tension: Control vs free will, gratitude vs resentment

  - Group Reaction: Feels like betrayal; later understood as sacrifice
  - Emotional Core: "You'll hate me for this, but I won't let you..."
  - Resolution: Forgiveness or permanent rift
  - Subtext: Character bears guilt/burden alone to protect others

## 6. SECRET DYNAMICS (The Hidden Connection)
- **Hidden Kinship**: Characters don't know they're related
  - Setup: Separated by fate, circumstance, war, or adoption
  - Recognition: Slow dawning realization OR shocking revelation
  - Implications: Changes power dynamics, alliance structures, emotional stakes
  
- **Shared Past**: Characters have a history neither expected
  - Setup: Met long ago, forgot each other, or were kept apart deliberately
  - Recognition: Trigger (object, place, phrase, face) sparks memory
  - Complications: Memory might be incomplete or distorted
  
- **Hidden Alliance**: Officially enemies; secretly coordinate
  - Setup: Neither wants to expose the truth
  - Communication: Coded language, specific signals, rare meetings
  - Risk: Exposure would destroy both characters' standing
  - Tension: Maintaining cover while coordinating

## 7. COMPLEX MULTI-LAYERED RELATIONSHIPS (The Web)
Many relationships should be COMPLEX, not fitting neatly into one category:
- Example: "Master/Apprentice + Slow Burn Romance + Hidden Betrayal"
- Example: "Friendly Rival + Secret Kinship + Ideological Opponent"
- Example: "Protector/VIP + Commanded Loyalty + Genuine Love"
- These create maximum narrative density and character complexity
